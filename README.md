## Fetch Data

Use JSON Placeholder API and display data to a webpage (Slide 69)

Create a web page that will read the posts from JSON Placeholder using
fetch.

Make use of the fetch API to retrieve data from the JSON Placeholder API and display it. Set the limit default to 10. When the page loads up, it will use the default value. 

Similar to the previous templating labs, use bootstrap cards and grids to layout the returned post data from JSON Placeholder on the page.
